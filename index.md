    ### CPSC 120

    * Lab 1

        One of the labs we worked on in this class that still stands out to me is the very first one we completed. By far, lab 1 was the simplest lab we did. This lab consisted of simply displaying text on the computer. While the final program was not the most interesting, having seen for the first time what goes into making computers do what you want them to do was very interesting. I immediately saw the potential to make very elaborate programs, so this lab stands out as one of my favorites for introducing me to the world of programming.

    * Lab 3

        Another lab that stands out to me as one of my favorites is lab #3. This lab involved making a calculator that finds a person's BMR. I found this lab very interesting because I am very into working out and use similar types of calculators all the time to track my progress. I had always blindly used them, but actually seeing what goes into making them work through the use of algorithms was very interesting to me.

    * Lab 6

        The final lab that stood out to me as one of my favorites was lab #6. In particular, the first part of the lab was what stood out to me because it involved learning how to make a type of program that I often use in my daily life. Anytime I go to order fast food, I use some type of application or website to order ahead. This lab introduced me to the basic way that these programs work, as well as expanding on the use of vectors, so it absolutely stands out to me as one of my favorite labs.
